## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Guy-Shalev/IntuitHomeAssignment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd IntuitHomeAssignment
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## üñ• Usage

Once the application is running, you can use tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client to interact with the API endpoints.

## üì° API Endpoints

### GET /api/players

Retrieve a list of players. This endpoint supports pagination and sorting.

The API can be used in the following ways:

* Without parameters (returns all players): 
  ```
  GET /api/players
  ```

* With pagination:
  ```
  GET /api/players?page=2&size=10
  ```
  - `page`: Page number (default: 0)
  - `size`: Number of items per page (default: 20)

* With sorting:
  ```
  GET /api/players?sort=nameFirst,asc
  ```
  - `sort`: Field to sort by, followed by sort direction (`asc` or `desc`)

* With pagination and sorting:
  ```
  GET /api/players?page=1&size=15&sort=nameLast,desc
  ```

Examples:
- Retrieve the first 20 players: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/players`
- Retrieve the second page of 10 players: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/players?page=1&size=10`
- Retrieve players sorted by first name in ascending order: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/players?sort=nameFirst,asc`
- Retrieve the second page of 15 players, sorted by last name in descending order: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/players?page=1&size=15&sort=nameLast,desc`

### GET /api/players/{playerID}

Retrieve details of a specific player.

Example: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/players/johnsm01`

Response: Returns detailed information about the player with ID 'johnsm01'.

## üß™ Testing

To run the tests, execute:

```sh
mvn test
```

## üìù Logging

- Logs are written to both the console and a file located at `logs/app.log`.
- The logging level for the application package is set to DEBUG.

## üíæ Database

- The application uses an H2 in-memory database.
- H2 console is enabled and can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` when the application is running.
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- Username: `sa`
- Password: `password`
